# Ideas

Grouped into chunks that are buildable in one go. Each chunk is meant to be
picked up whole: the pieces inside it touch the same code and share the same
decisions, so doing them together costs much less than doing them apart.

**An idea that ships is deleted from here.** `CHANGELOG.md` is the record of
what the app does and when it started doing it; a list that keeps its own
copy of that only tells you what someone remembered to tick. So this file
holds what is *not* built.

Chunk letters are stable — an entry keeps its id for life so notes and
commit messages that cite one still point at something, and an id is never
reused once its entry goes. Gaps (A, B, D, E, H, J, K, N, and most of G) are
where shipped work used to be. Old numbers are kept as "(was N)" where a code
comment still cites them.

Undecided and declined ideas live in `ideas_archived.md` — also not a done
list. Ideas for *new nodes* live in `node_ideas.md`; only the ones asked for
by name are repeated here. Status notes were checked against the code on
2026-08-27.

## C. Recovering work  (was 3)

**C4. Restore a crashed workflow from undo history** (was 3). Undo
history is in-memory only today, so this means persisting it somewhere
durable — worth a spike to size before it becomes a plan.

## F. Canvas performance

**F1. Drop to low LOD automatically when the frame rate falls.** A setting,
on by default: while panning (middle-mouse drag) at under 60 fps, switch
nodes to their flat paint until the pan ends. The pieces exist —
`NodeGraphScene.lod_enabled` / `lod_threshold` decide flattening by zoom
today, `BaseGraphicsView.fps` already measures redraw cost, and the
statistics window draws the 60 fps budget line — so this is a policy that
watches the measurement rather than new drawing code. Decide it with G2 in
front of you: they are the same trade-off from opposite sides.

## G. Canvas interaction

**G1. Pan by holding right-click**, as a setting.
Built and tried 2026-08-25, then taken back out the same day at Dan's
request — see `ideas_archived.md` #14 for what was learned and what
replaced it (a show-scroll-bars setting).

**G2. Show node names over the flat (low LOD) nodes.**

  Looked at 2026-08-11 and it is *not* the small job it reads as, so it is
  worth writing down before someone (me) picks it up expecting twenty
  minutes. `NodeItem._paint_flat` is deliberately "one fill, no
  path/gradient/text — the per-node cost that dominates when many nodes are
  visible at once". Text is precisely what it exists to avoid, so drawing a
  label in it walks back the optimisation that closed issue #2.

  Nor does drawing it normally help: flattening starts below lod 0.35, and
  a 9pt label at 0.3 is under 3px tall — there, but unreadable. To answer
  the actual question ("which node is that?") the labels have to be drawn
  at a *constant screen size*, ignoring zoom, like labels on a map. That
  brings the two real problems with it: the text cost comes back at exactly
  the zoom level where there are most nodes on screen, and at any distance
  the labels overlap each other into mush, so it needs a decluttering rule
  (draw the biggest/selected/hovered ones, drop the rest) to be any use.

  Both are decidable, but they need eyes on a real canvas, not a guess.
  Worth pairing with F1, which is the same trade-off from the other side.

## L. Version control

**L1. Optional git integration for a project.** Every save is a commit, so a
workflow gets full configuration history: browse it, diff it, roll back.
Opt-in per project. Sits well with the `.flograph` file being plain JSON.

---

## M. Nodes asked for by name

The broader wishlist is `node_ideas.md`; these are the ones asked for
directly.

**M2. User forms.** A form with fields and a submit button — one node, or a
node pair with a retrieval side — writing to a DataFrame, a SQL table, or
whatever else is useful. The Input category covers single values today;
this is the "capture a record" shape it cannot express.

---

## Elsewhere

- **Metanodes / subfolders / collapsible frames** (Stu, and a recurring
  ask). Already written up as `ideas_archived.md` #4, where it is parked as
  LARGE and undecided — decide it there rather than forking a second note.
